) “Time to Cross the Bridge: Factor Investing in Credit” → Credit-Market RQs

One-line thesis.
Can equity-style factor timing primitives (risk regime, signal intensity, valuation spread, positioning/crowding) be ported to credit to improve timing of carry, momentum, value, and vol premia in IG/HY ETFs, cash bonds, and CDX?

Hypotheses.
H1. Conditioning on a risk-sentiment regime (MOVE/VIX/GSI-like) increases out-of-sample IC/Sharpe for credit factors vs unconditional timing.
H2. Signal intensity (e.g., slope of spread carry, trend strength) and valuation spreads (cheap-expensive buckets) predict forward excess returns in credit similar to equities.
H3. Positioning/crowding (ETF ownership, dealer inventory, OI in CDX options) explains timing failures and drawdowns.

Universe.
LQD/VCIT/IGIB, HYG/JNK/SJNK, CDX IG/HY, cash bond baskets by rating/sector/term.

Data.
OAS levels/changes, TR-excess, ETF NAV vs price (premium/discount), volumes & bid-ask, creations/redemptions, CDX flows, TRACE prints, issuance, dealer inventory (where available), MOVE/VIX, macro surprises.

Signal construction.

Carry (credit): term/carry from curve (OAS kinks) + roll-down; intensity = cross-sectional z of ex-ante carry.

Momentum: 10–60d spread/price trend; strength = regression β & R²; “cheap/expensive momentum” via valuation buckets.

Value: sector/rating-normalized OAS vs fair-value curve; spread percentile.

Vol/liq stress: ETF premium/discount z, bid-ask z, volume surge ratio.

Crowding: ETF ownership shifts, AP activity proxies, CDX OI skew.

Tests.
Daily sorts (deciles by signal), Q10–Q1 forward TR-excess at 1/5/10/20d; IC & rank-IC; conditional versions by risk regime and valuation quartile; event-filtered windows (rolls, downgrades). Mirror the “scoreboard” style (regime × signal-intensity × valuation × positioning).

Strategy sketch.
Weekly rebalance; long-only tilt (alloc up-weighting top-quartile signals) and long–short (neutral to credit beta); size ∝ signal × liquidity × 1/vol; hard limits on HY/sector.

Robustness.
Rolling OOS, MOVE terciles, QE/QT, crisis windows; cost stress (5–20 bps ETFs; TRACE-based for cash); alternative definitions (EMA vs linear, β×R² vs additive), and attribution: how much comes from valuation spread vs signal intensity buckets akin to the paper’s framework.

Success gates.
OOS Sharpe ↑ ≥0.3 after costs vs baseline; stable IC decay curve; drawdown ≤ benchmark.

2) “Switching Styles” → Regime-Switch Timing for Credit Factors

One-line thesis.
Can a regime-switching (observable sentiment) allocator improve the timing of credit carry/momentum/value vs time-only allocators? The paper shows Regime-Switch MVO beat alternatives in OOS FX; we port that mechanic to credit.

What to port.

Use a sentiment index (observable, exogenous) and Markov transition among three regimes; allocate styles conditional on regime moments/covariances.

Out-of-sample, RS-MVO had the top Sharpe vs naïve, MinVar, MVSK, and style-momentum; inference: “moments are more regime-dependent than time-dependent.” Test this in credit.

Credit RQs.
RQ1. Do regime-conditioned means/covariances for (carry, momentum, value, liquidity-stress) in credit outperform unconditional timing?
RQ2. In which regimes does carry dominate (risk-seeking), momentum protect (risk-aversion), and value stabilize (medium/risk-off) in credit—mirroring the FX findings?

Build the credit sentiment index.
Inputs analogous to the paper’s mix: VIX/MOVE, IG/HY option-implied vol, IG/HY CDX skew, TED/credit liquidity, bank/insurer stress proxies, ETF premium/discount slope; standardize (rolling quantiles), take PC1 → 3 regimes with Markov transitions.

Design.

Estimate regime-conditional μ, Σ for factor returns (IG carry, HY carry, trend, value, liq-stress).

RS-MVO with risk target; compare to MinVar, MVSK, style-momentum (relative-strength of factors), and equal-weight baselines.

Evaluation.
OOS (rolling 2015–2019, 2020–2022, 2023–2025): Sharpe/Sortino, Q-spreads, turnover, drawdowns; weight-turnover diagnostics (style-momentum often over-trades; MinVar under-adapts—replicate these contrasts in credit).

Expected pattern to verify in credit.
Carry excels risk-on; momentum helps risk-off; value more tame/defensive; correlations change by regime (e.g., carry↔momentum turns more negative in stress). Confirm or refute.

3) “Enter SAM + New Pairs” → Live RS Allocator + Pairs for Credit

One-line thesis.
Operationalize a Style Allocation Model (SAM) for credit that emits weekly weights over (carry, momentum, value) from a Markov regime switcher, and add pairs that exploit cross-asset co-movement (ETF vs macro drivers).

What to port.

SAM bounds style weights (0–⅔ each) and sets them from an observable sentiment index with Markov transitions (productionized in FX). Apply the same loop to credit.

Paper’s pairs add (FX–commodities) links using short-horizon mean-reversion (5-min regressions). In credit, use ETF–macro or ETF–rate pairs.

Credit RQs.
RQ1. Do weekly SAM weights on (IG carry, HY carry, trend, value) beat static allocations after costs? RQ2. Which pairs (e.g., HYG↔SPX earnings breadth, LQD↔UST term premium, HYG↔WTI for energy-heavy HY) deliver stable reversion alphas?

SAM (credit) build.

Sentiment index (MOVE, VIX, CDX IV, ETF prem/discount, TED, bank CDS).

Regime transitions (3-state Markov).

Weekly weights for factor sleeves; capacity & turnover limits.

Pairs menu (reversion, intraday–multi-day).

HYG vs Crude (energy beta); EMB vs DXY; LQD vs 10y-term premium; HYG vs credit impulse proxy; CDX HY vs SPX (beta-hedged).

5–60min regressions, z-score entry, beta-neutral, trend filter to avoid strong-trend traps (as noted in the SAM note: macro noise can whipsaw low-freq momentum—pairs thrive there).

Evaluation.

SAM: OOS Sharpe, turnover, drawdown, weight-path stability.

Pairs: hit-rate, avg. holding time, slippage vs ADV, stress performance.

Risk.
Policy shocks → regime flips; de-linking of pairs (monitor half-life, rolling R²); ETF microstructure (AP frictions) during stress.
