Bond Carry Strategy — Quantpedia / Algorithm Implementation

Main Research Question:

Can a cross-sectional carry strategy—buying high-yielding sovereign bonds and shorting (or avoiding) low-yielding ones—generate sustainable excess returns across countries?

Core Hypothesis:
Bond yields reflect embedded carry premia: higher nominal yields compensate for duration and currency risk, not purely macro fundamentals.

Mechanism Tested:

Universe: 30 countries’ 10-year government bonds.

Each month:

Sort by nominal yield.

Go long the top 1/3 (highest yielders).

Rebalance monthly with equal weights.

Interpretation:
This is a global sovereign bond value/carry strategy, analogous to FX carry or equity value factors — exploiting yield differentials as a priced risk premium.

Applications to Credit Trading:

Extend logic to corporate bond spreads: overweight issuers/sectors with higher yield per unit of duration or liquidity risk.

Potential to construct cross-country or sectoral credit carry portfolios using CDS or bond indices.

Carry signals may predict spread compression cycles or default risk premia across regimes.

🌍 II. Faber (2016) — “Finding Yield in a 2% World”

Main Research Questions:

Can a value-based allocation to global sovereign bonds (selecting based on yield rather than debt weight) outperform traditional capitalization-weighted benchmarks?

In a world of compressed yields, does global diversification and value selection add income and risk-adjusted return?

Key Idea:
Cap-weighted global bond indices overweight the most indebted countries (issuers with the largest debt stock).
Faber proposes yield-weighted selection as a form of “bond value investing.”

Findings:

High-yield sovereigns outperform low-yield sovereigns on both absolute and risk-adjusted bases.

Yield-based selection produces higher income and similar volatility, improving Sharpe ratios across multiple decades.

Application to Credit Trading:

The same principle applies within credit universes:

Traditional benchmarks overweight the largest issuers (often riskier, lower-yielding post-spread compression).

A “value” approach reallocating toward higher spread sectors can enhance return per unit of risk.

Use for benchmark redesign — from capitalization-weighted to yield- or spread-weighted credit indices.

📈 III. Ilmanen, Israel, Moskowitz, Thapar, & Wang (2020) — “Factor Premia and Factor Timing: A Century of Evidence”

SSRN Link

Main Research Questions:

Are factor premia (value, momentum, carry, defensive) stable across time, markets, and asset classes?

Can factor premia be timed profitably using macro or valuation indicators?

Findings:

Factor returns persist across 100+ years and six asset classes.

Out-of-sample performance drops ~30% but remains positive — evidence of robustness, not overfitting.

Carry is a persistent return source in bonds, equities, FX, and commodities.

Timing factors (e.g., conditioning on valuation or volatility) rarely adds significant alpha after costs.

Application to Credit Trading:

Validates carry as a cross-asset premium, reinforcing its use in credit spread strategies.

Suggests factor diversification (carry + momentum + defensive) can enhance Sharpe in multi-asset credit portfolios.

Timing the credit carry (e.g., entering when spreads are wide) may work in theory but suffers from implementation friction and lagged data.

🧮 IV. Min & Dong (2024) — “The Drivers of Global Government Bond Returns”

SSRN Link

Main Research Questions:

Do forward rates predict future realized returns across maturities and currencies?

Can a dynamic yield-curve positioning approach (favoring higher forward-rate markets) improve global bond performance?

Findings:

Forward rates are reliable predictors of relative bond performance across maturities and currencies.

Portfolios overweighting higher forward-rate markets earn persistent excess returns.

“Dynamic yield curve selection” enhances return efficiency across regimes and interest rate environments.

Application to Credit Trading:

Replace “forward rates” with credit forward spreads or implied spread term premia to dynamically tilt across credit tenors.

Forward-rate logic can inform curve positioning (front-end vs. long-end spread carry).

Integrates with systematic duration/curve risk overlays for credit portfolios.
