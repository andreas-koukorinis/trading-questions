1. Do financial instruments exhibit systematic and statistically significant intraday seasonality patterns across different trading sessions?
Application to Credit Trading:
Credit instruments (corporate bonds, CDS, loans) may show predictable price movements during specific intraday windows due to institutional trading patterns, liquidity provision schedules, or regional market activity.
Research Workflow Required:
Data Requirements:

Tick-by-tick or minute-level pricing data for credit instruments (5+ years minimum)
Bid-ask spreads at high frequency
Transaction volumes by time bucket
Trading venue identifiers (electronic vs. voice)
Regional trading hour timestamps (standardized to GMT)

Time Zone Definitions:

Asia session: 00:00-07:00 GMT
London morning: 07:00-12:00 GMT
Mixed London/NY: 12:00-16:00 GMT
NY afternoon: 16:00-20:00 GMT

Metrics to Measure:

Returns by time zone: Calculate price changes within each session
T-statistics: Mean return divided by standard deviation for statistical significance
Hit ratios: Percentage of days showing expected directional move
Magnitude: Absolute basis point moves per session
Liquidity metrics: Bid-ask spread, market depth by time zone

Statistical Tests:

T-tests for significance of returns (|t-stat| > 1.65 for 90% confidence)
Rolling window analysis for robustness over time
Regression with time zone dummy variables


2. Do credit instruments exhibit home market bias, whereby they weaken during domestic trading hours and strengthen during foreign trading hours?
Application to Credit Trading:
US corporate bonds may systematically weaken during NY hours as US asset managers become net suppliers, similar to FX findings. European corporate bonds may weaken during London hours.
Research Workflow Required:
Data Requirements:

Segmented by issuer domicile (US, EUR, UK, Asia)
Issuer-level characteristics (sector, rating, maturity)
Flow data showing buy/sell imbalance by region
Asset manager end-of-day rebalancing times
Corporate action calendars (earnings, bond calls)

Metrics to Measure:

Domestic vs. foreign session returns: Compare price changes during home market hours vs. offshore hours
Order flow imbalance: Net buying pressure by time zone
Spread widening/tightening patterns: Do credit spreads widen more in domestic hours?
Net supply pressure: Issuance timing vs. trading hours

Analysis Framework:

Separate instruments by domicile
Calculate median returns for domestic vs. foreign sessions
Test for statistical significance of difference
Control for volatility regime


3. Which intraday time windows exhibit the highest breadth (number of instruments affected) versus highest magnitude (size of price moves) of seasonality?
Application to Credit Trading:
Identify whether credit seasonality is more concentrated (large moves in few bonds) or dispersed (small moves across many bonds). This determines optimal strategy capacity and diversification.
Research Workflow Required:
Data Requirements:

Large cross-section of credit instruments (100+ bonds minimum)
Standardized return calculations across instruments
Sector and rating breakdowns
New issuance calendar (primary market activity)

Metrics to Measure:

Breadth: Count of instruments with |t-stat| > 2 in each time zone
Magnitude: Median of statistically significant t-statistics
Economic significance: Median absolute return in basis points
Coverage ratio: % of universe showing significant patterns
Cross-sectional correlation: How synchronized are the moves

Analysis Approach:

Calculate t-stats for all instruments across all time zones
Rank time zones by breadth (count of significant results)
Rank time zones by magnitude (size of median moves)
Create heatmaps showing concentration patterns


4. Do intraday seasonality patterns exhibit calendar effects, with certain months showing stronger seasonal patterns than others?
Application to Credit Trading:
Portfolio rebalancing, index rolls, quarter-end, and year-end flows create predictable monthly patterns in credit markets. December may show strongest effects due to tax-loss selling and year-end window dressing.
Research Workflow Required:
Data Requirements:

Multi-year daily data segmented by month
Index rebalancing dates (CDX rolls, bond index reconstitutions)
Corporate calendar events (earnings seasons)
Fiscal year-end dates for major institutions
Holiday calendars

Metrics to Measure:

Monthly t-statistics: Run separate regressions for each month
Seasonal decomposition: Isolate monthly effects from trend
Quarter-end vs. mid-quarter: Compare patterns around calendar events
Tax-timing effects: December vs. January patterns
Index roll timing: Performance around CDX roll dates

Statistical Framework:

12 separate regressions (one per month) with time zone dummies
Test for significance of monthly variation
Control for volatility, issuance activity, and macro events
Build conditional models that adjust for calendar


5. Are intraday seasonality patterns robust across different volatility regimes, or do they break down during market stress?
Application to Credit Trading:
Understanding whether credit seasonality persists during crises is crucial for risk management and strategy resilience. Strategies relying on low-vol quirks may fail when most needed.
Research Workflow Required:
Data Requirements:

Volatility measures: VIX, MOVE index, OAS volatility
Regime definitions (low/medium/high vol quantiles)
Crisis period identifiers (2008, 2020 COVID, 2022 rates volatility)
Liquidity metrics during stress (bid-ask spreads, fails)

Metrics to Measure:

Conditional t-statistics: Calculate separately for each vol regime
Regime stability: Compare hit ratios across regimes
Magnitude ratios: Do moves get bigger or smaller in high vol?
Breadth changes: Does seasonality concentrate or disperse in stress?
Liquidity adjustment: Are patterns stronger/weaker when liquidity is poor?

Volatility Regime Definition:

Low vol: MOVE/VIX < 25th percentile
Medium vol: 25th-75th percentile
High vol: >75th percentile

Analysis:

Calculate seasonality metrics separately for each regime
Test whether t-statistics differ significantly across regimes
Assess economic vs. statistical significance in each regime


6. Can systematic trading strategies based on intraday seasonality patterns generate statistically significant and economically meaningful returns after transaction costs?
Application to Credit Trading:
Credit markets have wider bid-ask spreads and higher transaction costs than FX, requiring larger seasonal effects to be profitable. Strategy design must account for execution friction.
Research Workflow Required:
Data Requirements:

Executable prices (not just mid-market)
Transaction cost data (bid-ask spreads, commission, clearing)
Market impact models for realistic execution
Funding costs (repo rates for leveraged positions)
Capacity constraints (market depth by instrument)

Metrics to Measure:

Gross returns: Raw P&L from seasonal patterns
Transaction costs: Estimated per-trade costs in bps
Net Sharpe ratio: Risk-adjusted returns after costs
Maximum drawdown: Worst peak-to-trough decline
Hit ratio: % of profitable trades
Capacity: Maximum AUM before market impact degrades returns

Strategy Construction:

Identify statistically significant patterns (t-stat > 2)
Calculate expected return per time zone
Subtract estimated transaction costs
Construct portfolio of tradeable positions
Backtest with realistic execution assumptions
Calculate risk-adjusted performance metrics

Transaction Cost Model:

Entry spread: % of bid-ask at trade initiation
Exit spread: % of bid-ask at trade close
Market impact: Function of order size / daily volume
Financing costs: Repo rate Ã— holding period
Operational costs: Clearing, custody, technology
